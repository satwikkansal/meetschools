There is no variety, no opportunities for your child.Those who are doing well there are happy. However, those who are unable to reach out or express themselves, must be experiencing hell. The teachers do nothing at all to reach out to the not- so bright or perhaps, lost children. They read the chapter, do the question answers and thats it. You are ready. Everyone knows the truth, the reason children score well is either because of the tuitions or their guardians help.It had been three years of hell for me. After switching schools, I have realised that there are people who understand and know how to harness a child's potential.
